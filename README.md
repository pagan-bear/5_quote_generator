# OC Project 5 - JavaScript Quote Generator

This first project was specially designed for those new to the JavaScript programming and algorithms. Your objective will be both simple and fun: you will build a random quote generator! The quotes will be randomly constructed by assembling different pieces of a sentence.

Create a quotation generator full of random words!
Create a quotation generator!

## Step 1: Random quotes
There are plenty of text generators online. Google "quote generator," and you will find many sites that randomly generate quotes by assembling sentence fragments.

Your turn to create one! You must respect the following criteria:
* The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call
* Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end
* The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)
* The program can simply display each result in the JavaScript console.

Files to provide:
* A JavaScript file of your code

## Step 2: More customized quotes

You now want to go further and offer the following options:
* Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)
* Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences)

Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program

Adapt the program so that it has these features!

Files to provide:
* A JavaScript file of your code

## Presentation
You'll do an oral presentation of your project with a mentor in order to simulate real-life conditions. 

The presentation will be structured as follows:  
* Presentation of your code and your quotation generator: 15-20 minutes
* Q&A: 10 minutes
* Towards the end of the presentation, the mentor will debrief you for approximately 5 minutes.

Skills
* Design an algorithm to meet a specification
* Implement the JavaScript syntax in a program
